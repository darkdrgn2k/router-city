# Autonomous System Numbers

Each organization on the router.city network with control of an address block will need a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) to identify the organization's network.

AS numbers will be assigned from the `64496 - 64511` range, which is reserved space for documentation and source code examples.

## Current ASN Allocations

| ASN   | User          |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 64496 | [Famicoman](https://github.com/Famicoman)|
| 64497 | [mikenabhan](https://github.com/mikenabhan)|

This range may change at any time if it is found to conflict with another range or be unusable for any reason.
